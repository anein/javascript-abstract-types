Collection of Javascript Abstract Types

## Types
* [List](./src/listadt.js) - an ordered sequence of data.
* [Singly Linked List](./src/singlyLinkedList.js) - a collection of objects called nodes.
* [Circularly Linked List](./src/circularlyLinkedList.js) - has its head node's next property point back to itself.
* [Doubly Linked List](./src/doublyLinkedList.js) - a list that contains links to next and previous nodes.
* [Stack](./src/stack.js) - a list of elements that are accessible only from one end of the list.
* [Queue](./src/queue.js) - a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the front.
* [Dictionary](./src/dictionary.js) - a data structure that stores data as key-value paris.
* [Hashtable](./src/hashtable.js) - a common technique for storing data in such a way that the data can be inserted and retrieved very quickly.
* [Set](./src/set.js) - a collection of unique elements.
* [Binary Search Tree](./src/binarySearchTree.js) - a binary tree in which data with lesser values are stored in left nodes and data with greater values are stored in right nodes.
